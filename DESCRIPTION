Description: This package contains a collection of 38 publicly available bulk or single-cell RNA-seq datasets specific to leukemia disease from either TCGA(https://www.cancer.gov/ccg/research/genome-sequencing/tcga) or GEO(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) data reprositories. In this study, we employed various statistical methods to construct a comprehensive leukemia reference atlas using transcriptome profiles from 23 independent studies, encompassing a total of 1,807 samples. We then utilized this reference atlas to accurately classify patients by projecting query data obtained from either bulk or single-cell sequencing technologies onto it.
